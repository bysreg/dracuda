<p>We are going to create a cloud-based real-time CUDA ray tracer application framework which helps developing graphics demanding applications.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>In computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. As such, ray tracing is able to simulate necessary effects to create photorealistic images. However, a high-quality ray tracing can take very long time to render, and is not suitable for real-time applications.
</p>

<p>GPU, as a powerful SIMD processing unit, performs well in data-parallel and math-intensive tasks. Essential operations in ray tracing, such as intersection tests, transformations, vector math and shading are all GPU-friendly. According to several benchmarks provided by developers in universities, GPU ray tracers implementations had 100x - 300x speedup compared to CPU counterparts. It is then proved that GPU is a natural choice for ray tracing and is much more suitable than CPU.</p>

<p>With the advent of cloud computing, it is possible to access massive computing resources without actually purchasing them. Even GPU computing instances have become available in the past few years. Therefore, with enough GPUs, real-time rendering is possible without sacrificing the quality.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Challenge</h3>
<p>
Performance
<ul>
<li>Network Latency. The latency from Pittsburgh to Amazon US East server is 23 ms. A round-trip would be 46 ms. For a player to not experience lag, the latency has to be below 100 ms, so that furtuer restricts the rendering time under 50 ms.</li>
<li>Load Balancing Algorithm. Different compute nodes have different rendering performance and network latency. Therefore it is necessary to balance the overall latency of all nodes using an adaptive algorithm.</li>
<li>Efficient GPU ray tracing implementation. Even though ray tracing is highly parallelizable, there are branch divergences in intersection tests, refraction / reflections, which can cause huge performance slowdown if not handled properly.</li>
</ul>
Graphics
<ul>
<li>Photorealistic Rendering. To make the rendering as pretty as possible, some effects like caustics, subsurface scattering, diffuse reflection are both difficult to simulate and computationally intensive.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
We have taken 15-662 Computer Graphics and developed a ray tracer on CPU. We will rewrite the ray tracer on GPU. During the development, we will use GHC clusters with GPU to test. We will also make sure it works on Amazon EC2, and will run the demo game on it.
